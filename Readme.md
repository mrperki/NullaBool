# NullaBool

You need NULL. You love BOOL. At long last, the two can coexist. NullaBool. It's open-source. It's RESTful. It's DevOps. It's thread safe (probably). And best of all: it's both bool and null. Better together, like chocolate and onions. Or so we've heard.

NullaBool is the solution nobody wanted for a problem nobody has. It represents every possible state of NULL and BOOL together, and includes some bonus states that will make you wonder ~~whether someone should check whether the developers of this project are okay~~ why they haven't existed until now. Some say that NullaBool is just a bizarre implementation of bool? (or "nullable bool" if you're from the UK). Some say it's much more than that. Because it is. Just accept it.

Add NullaBool to your .NET project today, and see for yourself what all the nullababool is about.
